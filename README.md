### Hello, World!

I'm Rodrigo Peixe Oliveira (you can call me Rodd), a Computer Science student at the Federal University of SÃ£o Paulo (UNIFESP), Brazil. 

I love videogames, and I love programming. Naturally, I also love programming videogames! You can check some of my projects on the pinned repos below, and also don't forget to check my [itch.io](https://rpeixe.itch.io/)!
